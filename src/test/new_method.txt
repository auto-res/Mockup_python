<ELEMENTAL_METHOD name="Momentum Calculation and Application">
This method involves computing the moving average of the gradients (also known as the first moment) and using this to update the model parameters. It's a technique used to accelerate gradients vectors in the right directions, thus leading to faster converging. It is widely used in optimization algorithms, including as a component of the Adam optimizer.

<PYTHON>
def momentum_update(lr, beta1, params, objective, weight_decay, epsilon):
    m = 0  # first moment
    theta = params
    while True:
        g = np.gradient(objective(theta), theta)  # gradient of objective function
        if weight_decay != 0:
            g += weight_decay * theta
        m = beta1 * m + (1 - beta1) * g
        theta -= lr * m
        yield theta
